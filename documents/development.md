# Development Plan for GameGen2

This document outlines potential improvements and enhancements for the GameGen2 project to align with best practices and ensure scalability, maintainability, and user satisfaction.

## 1. Security Enhancements
- **CSRF Protection**: Implement CSRF tokens for all forms and API requests.
- **Input Validation**: Add server-side validation for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Session Security**: Ensure session cookies are marked as `Secure` and `HttpOnly`.

## 2. Scalability Improvements
- **Session Management**: Use a distributed session store (e.g., Redis) for better scalability.

## 3. Maintainability
- **Code Documentation**: Add more inline comments and docstrings for clarity.
- **Modularization**: Refactor large functions into smaller, reusable components.

## 4. Performance Optimization
- **Static File Caching**: Add caching headers for static files to improve load times.
- **Optimize Queries**: If using a database, ensure queries are optimized with proper indexing.

## 5. User Experience (UX)
- **Accessibility**: Add ARIA roles and labels to improve accessibility for screen readers.
- **Error Feedback**: Provide more descriptive error messages for user actions.

## 6. Testing
- **Unit Tests**: Write unit tests for critical components like authentication and session management.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between the server and the client.
- **End-to-End Tests**: Simulate user workflows to ensure the application behaves as expected.

## 7. Compliance
- **GDPR Compliance**: Add a privacy policy and allow users to delete their data.
- **Cookie Consent**: Implement a cookie consent banner for compliance with regulations.

## 8. Error Handling
- **Centralized Logging**: Use a logging library to capture and store error logs.
- **Graceful Failures**: Ensure the application provides fallback mechanisms for unexpected errors.

## 9. Version Control
- **Commit Messages**: Use descriptive commit messages to document changes.

## 10. HTTPS Note
- **Clarification**: This project does not handle HTTPS directly. It is assumed that the main server or reverse proxy managing access to this project is responsible for HTTPS enforcement.

## 11. Database Preference
- **JSON Database**: The project will continue to use JSON files for data storage as per the stated preference. Ensure that the JSON database is optimized for performance and scalability within the current architecture.
